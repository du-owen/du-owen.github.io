In Lab Manual 5, we needed 107 LUT for our implementation of the ALU. Here, after implementing the 32-bit adder using our 4-bit adder from Lab 2, the number of LUTs
increased to 122. Therefore, one can conclude, that the synthesis tool of Vivado indeed chooses the cheapest (smallest) design out of many that still meets the
programmer's specifications. Because building a 32-bit adder out of 4-bit adders is a quite basic implementation, it isn't really optimized in regards to size and 
timing compared to Vivado's implementation.
